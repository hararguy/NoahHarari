              <p>Hello, my name is Noah Harari.</p>
              <p>I am a student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, studying International Business & Real Estate.</p>
              <p>This website is my personal media space and here for you to browse freely. If you would like to get in touch, please refer to my <a href="ContactPage.html" target="_blank"> <u>contact page</u></a>.</p>
              <p>A Little Bit About Me:</p>
              <p>Since 2020, I've been obsessed with creating value out of my passions. I made this website to showcase my passion projects and eventually catch the eye of the right audience. My love for European sports cars has led me to create a personal gallery of those I've encountered and driven around Los Angeles, spanning across to New York City. The profound experiences I've had in nature, my love for hiking, snowboarding, and all things outdoors, and my immersion into the hiking culture and fashion scene has led to create Gone Hiking Madison. The first social media community wisconsin Hikers go to for inspiration, trail recommendations, and general influence for all things outdoors. And finally, my excitement for travel, culture, arts, and fashion inspired me to keep a log of my favorite vacations and memorable experiences I've had abroad.

              <p>My Professional Experiences:</p>
              <p><a href="https://www.clutchcarclub.com/" target="_blank"><u>Clutch Car Club, LLC:</u></a></p>
              <p>I spent my 2023 summer working as a client advisor and lot porter at Clutch Car Club, LLC, a private auto group and dealership right outside Calabasas in Agoura Hills. Clutch's main business was buying cars from their usual clientel and the general public and then flipping them for wholesale prices at auction. 
                I think my biggest takeaway from working under Alon Cohen, CEO, and Ramsey Carey, COO, at Clutch is that in order to present a valuable offer to a client, you need to present a unique value that isn't just a number. While anyone can go to a dealership to get rid of their cars, nobody wants to spend hours of their time visiting various dealers and receiving even lower wholesale prices than Clutch usually offers. 
              During my summer at Clutch, I closed on a few deals, my favorites being: 
            a 2020 Lincoln Aviator, making the company $2.25k, a 2023 Porsche Taycan, which actually lost about $1k, and a 2022 Bentley Continental GT, making the company $4.125k. Not all of my deals were winners, but volume speaks for itself, and the only thing that really matters is if you can bring the company value. 
          Additionally, working on the creative side of a business proved to be as fun as it sounds. Driving and filming content for vehichles, working on ad campaigns, and developing long-term client relationships made my time at Clutch even more valuable than I can make it sound.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.westcord.com/" target="_blank"> <u>Westcord Commercial Real Estate:</u></a></p>
                <p>I spent my 2022 summer working as a commercial real estate intern at Westcord's Westlake Village office. Working at a boutique-sized firm that acquires, manages, and sells over $100 million worth of real estate across the San Fernando Valley gave me an excellent grasp of the daily operations of a successful CRE office.
                  Westcord shines when it comes to Feasibility and project underwriting, acquisition and due diligence, development consulting, financing, property management, 1031 exchange, investment analysis, and more. 
                  Working under Tony Principe, President, I learned what being a successful principal and manager entails, along with maintaining a productive work environment. I would not have retained the mass of knowledge I now have on property acquisition and management, maintaining client relationships, and holding an insanely impressive work ethic if it wasn't for Jeremy and Drew Principe, commercial sales & leasing.

                <p><a href="https://superiorloanservicing.com/" target="_blank"> <u>Superior Loan Servicing</u></a></p>
                <p>Through some valuable connections I have within the company, I've spent a few summers and some time while in highschool working at SLS on various projects they needed assistance with. SLS provides stress-free loan servicing for private lenders. 
                  Working at their offices, I got a valuable introduction to the real estate finance field, and gained a solid foundation of what scaling a financial services business requires. Special thank you to Scott Hacker, COO & VP, for being an excellent mentor and granting me with irreplaceable business experience.
